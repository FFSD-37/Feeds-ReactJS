## ⚙️ Project Component Assignment

Each member is assigned **parent components** to develop.  
All components must be placed inside the **`components/`** folder and style should be created in **`styles/`** folder.  
You can create **child components** freely under these parent components.

---

### 🧠 Guidelines

- Inside every component, **variable names should start with the component name** to prevent naming conflicts.  
  Example:  
  If your component is named `profile_card`, your variables could be:  
  `profile_card_name`, `profile_card_age`, `profile_card_email`, etc.

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for quick and clean structuring.

- Ensure all **forms are validated** (all required fields).

- If you have **any doubts**, ask in the **WhatsApp GROUP chat**.

- You may **exchange pages mutually** if you’re not comfortable with your current assignment.
